# Week 2 — Arrays, Strings & Encryption

This week focused on string manipulation, character arrays, ASCII values and simple encryption algorithms using C.

### Projects completed:
- ✅ Scrabble — Letter scoring game using point mapping
- ✅ Readability — Coleman-Liau index implementation
- ✅ Substitution — Monoalphabetic cipher with a custom key

Each project explores how strings are stored and processed in memory, how to map characters to values, and how encryption is built from logic alone
