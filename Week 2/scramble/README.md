# Scrabble

Simulates a simplified version of the Scrabble word game.

### 🧠 What it does:
- Asks two players to input a word
- Scores each word based on a points table (A–Z)
- Declares the winner (or a tie)

### 🔍 Logic used:
- Arrays (letter-to-score mapping)
- ASCII index conversion
- Input validation with `isalpha()`
- Case-insensitive scoring

### 🧪 Example:

Player 1: CODE
Player 2: QUIZ
Player 2 wins!
