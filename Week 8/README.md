# CS50 Week 8 – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Overview

Week 8 introduces the foundational technologies of web development: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. You’ll learn how to build interactive, styled, and structured web pages. This week sets the groundwork for creating dynamic front-end applications.

## Objectives

* Structure web pages using **HTML5**
* Style elements with **CSS3** (including Flexbox and Grid)
* Add interactivity with **JavaScript** (DOM manipulation, events)
* Understand the client-side programming model
* Build responsive and user-friendly UIs

## Technologies Introduced

* HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
* JavaScript (ES6+ syntax)

## Key Concepts Covered

* HTML structure: elements, attributes, semantic tags
* CSS styling: selectors, layout techniques, responsive design
* JavaScript: variables, functions, conditionals, loops
* DOM: selecting, modifying, and responding to HTML elements
* Event handling and dynamic behavior

## Problem Set: Homepage

Build a personal homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Requirements:

* At least four separate HTML pages
* Styled with CSS (internal, external, or both)
* Includes interactive elements (e.g., buttons, form inputs, DOM manipulation)
* Consistent navigation UI across all pages
* Responsive layout recommended

## Files

* `index.html`: The main landing page
* `about.html`, `projects.html`, `contact.html`: Additional content pages
* `styles.css`: External stylesheet with consistent design rules
* `script.js`: JavaScript file handling page interactivity

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser:

```bash
open index.html
```

Or deploy using GitHub Pages or any static hosting platform.

## Tips

* Keep HTML semantic and accessible
* Use CSS Flexbox/Grid for layout instead of floats
* Test interactivity by modifying DOM elements and handling events in `script.js`
* Separate concerns: structure (HTML), style (CSS), logic (JS)
