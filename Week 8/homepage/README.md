# CS50 Week 8 – Homepage Project

## Overview

The Homepage project is a culmination of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts learned in Week 8. The goal is to create a personal, multipage website that is well-structured, styled, and includes some interactive elements.

## Objectives

* Build a semantic, accessible multipage website
* Apply CSS to achieve a consistent visual design
* Enhance user experience with interactive JavaScript elements
* Structure content effectively with HTML5

## Requirements

* At least **four separate HTML pages** (e.g., home, about, contact, projects)
* At least **one external CSS file** for consistent styling
* At least **one JavaScript file** for interactivity
* A **navigation bar** or consistent menu across all pages
* Use of at least:

  * One table
  * One list
  * One image
  * One form
  * One responsive design technique (e.g., media queries)

## File Structure

```
homepage/
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── contact.html
├── projects.html
├── styles.css
├── script.js
└── assets/
    ├── images/
    └── other/
```

## Usage

To view the site, simply open `index.html` in a browser:

```bash
open index.html
```

To deploy online, use GitHub Pages or any static site host.

## Tips

* Use semantic HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
* Write DRY CSS and keep consistent spacing and design rules
* Modularize your JS code for maintainability
* Make sure your site works well on mobile screens (test with responsive mode in browser dev tools)

## Optional Enhancements

* Add animations with CSS or JS
* Include a light/dark theme toggle
* Use icons (e.g., Font Awesome)
* Add a contact form that integrates with a service like Formspree
