### Goal:
Build a right-aligned pyramid based on a user-defined height, using `#` for bricks.

### Logic:
- Ask user for a height between 1 and 8
- Use nested `for` loops to:
  - Print spaces for alignment
  - Print bricks in increasing number per row

### What I learned:
- How to use nested loops
- Translating visual structure into code
- Managing indentation and spacing

### Output example:
Height: 4
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
