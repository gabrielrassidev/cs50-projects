# 🧩 CS50 — Week 1 Projects

This week focused on the fundamentals of the C language:
- Syntax and structure
- `main()`, `printf()`, `#include`
- Variables and types
- Conditions (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Logical operators
- Modulo and integer math

Below are the projects I completed this week — each one solving a specific logic challenge using C.

### [hello](./hello/)
Prints a greeting. The classic “hello, world” — first contact with C.

### [mario](./mario/)
Generates a right-aligned pyramid using `#`, based on user input. A loop and alignment challenge.
